        <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
        <h3>Expressions</h3>
        <p>This program evaluates arithmetic expressions constructed from the four binary
            operators (+, -, *, /), floating points numeric values, and variables. The 
            program builds an expression tree representing the infix expression string 
            passed as argument, and the tree can later be evaluated or displayed via
            recursive traversals. Input strings must separate all tokens, including parens,
            with one or more spaces.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Tester</h3>
        <p>This program is an HTML helper that takes URL's and checks whether there are
            formatting errors on the page. The program watches for a specific set of paired 
            tags and then repeatedly prompts the user for URL's of pages to check.
        </p>
        <h3>Tic-Tac-To Tournament</h3>
        <p>This program simulates a game of tic-tac-to. The program contains 4 different
            types of players. One player places themself in the corners of the board,
            one player always places themself in the center, one player places
            themself at the next open spot, and the last player would place themself
            in a random spot. The program prints out a simulated game and prints the 
            responses of the players.
