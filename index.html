        <h1>Moving to America</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Seung Park. My family is originally from Korea, but we immigrated
            to the states (specifically Alabama) right before I turned 1 years old.
        </p>
        <h1>Entering Highschool</h1>
        <p>My family finally decided to move to Washington state when I was entering into
            highschool. During my highschool years, I performed in a play, swam in my
            school's swim team, and sang in the top choir. As the time for graduation
            approached, I decided to apply to the University of Puget Sound.
        </p>
        <h1>Turning Another Chapter In My Life</h1>
        <p>Upon arriving at UPS I aspired to major in music, but I later
            decided to switch to become an International Political Economy major. However,
            I again decided to finally switch majors into Computer Science. I have always tried
            to run away from all things STEM, but I ended up falling in love with Computer Science.
