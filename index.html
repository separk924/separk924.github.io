        <h1>Moving to America</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Seung Park. My family is originally from Korea, but we moved
            to the states right before I turned 1 years old. We moved around often from 
            Georgia, to Florida, and to Alabama.
        </p>
        <h1>Entering Highschool</h1>
        <p>My family finally decided to move to Washington state when I was entering into
            highschool. During my highschool years, I performed in a play, swam in my
            school's swimming team, and sang in the top choir. As the time for graduation
            approached, I decided to apply to the University of Puget Sound.
        </p>
        <h1>Turning Another Chapter In My Life</h1>
        <p>Arriving at UPS, I thought that I would major in music. I later
            decided to switch to become an International Political Economy major. However,
            I again decided to switch majors into Computer Science.
